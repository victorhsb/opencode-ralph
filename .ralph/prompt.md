# SDK Migration

Implement the OpenCode SDK migration for Open Ralph Wiggum v2.0.0.

## What to Do

1. Consider your currently assigned task.
2. Read the relevant phase document in `plans/sdk-refactor/phase-N.md` for details
3. Complete that ONE task fully
4. Update ralph-tasks.md: change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for the completed task
5. Update the plan with your status and any future reference for other agents that might come after you. 
6. Output `<promise>READY_FOR_NEXT_TASK</promise>` when (and only WHEN) the task is ready.

## Output

- After one task: `<promise>READY_FOR_NEXT_TASK</promise>`
- All tasks done: `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`

Start by reading `.ralph/ralph-tasks.md` to find the next incomplete task.
